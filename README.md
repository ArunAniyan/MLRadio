Machine Learning Tutorial for radio astronomers

This repo contains two simple practical tutorials for machine learning that were used to teach radio astronomers a first course in machine learning methods applied to radio astronomy data.

There are two notebooks:


    1. 3GCIV-Machine-Learning-Tutorial-Pulsar Prediction.ipynb - ML applied to detect pulsars
  
    2. 3GC-Machine-Learning-NeuralNetwork.ipynb - Neural networks applied to classify radio sources
